## Structure

* /shanes_work - shanes stuff (private work-folder)
* /colins_work - colins stuff (private work-folder)
* /base_implementation - fixed receiver, transmitter
* /decentralized_implementation - decentralized approach
* /plots - archive for cool gifs and plots to be used in the future

## Deadlines

4/11: fixed Tx/Rx
4/17: one page description due at beginning of class
5/8: 5-8 page report


## 4/4/17:

look at apsk, bpsk, qpsk, 16-quam
do we want to whether we want to paramaterize output of transmitter as cartesian or polar?

fixed Tx, learn Rx:
⋅⋅⋅input x,y of complex, softmax output + eps greedy / boltzman exploration


## 4/18/17:
tasks:
1. reward shaping for transmitter (need to restrict power and maximize distance between points. former must be stronger than latter to prevent outer points from flying away)

2. Tx -> Rx and Rx gives reward back to Tx. Rx provides k-nn guess for each datasample back to Tx
3. Tx on both sides, Rx on both sides. 
4. OpenAI style
