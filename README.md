## Deadlines

4/11: fixed Tx/Rx
4/17: one page description due at beginning of class
5/8: 5-8 page report


## 4/4/17:

look at apsk, bpsk, qpsk, 16-quam
do we want to whether we want to paramaterize output of transmitter as cartesian or polar?

fixed Tx, learn Rx:
⋅⋅⋅input x,y of complex, softmax output + eps greedy / boltzman exploration


tasks:
1. fix Tx, learn Rx - Daniel (plot decision boundaries)
2. fix Rx, learn Tx - Shane
⋅⋅⋅network arch, noise, episode length, lambda, 
⋅⋅⋅tweak channel impairments
4. ~~varaible length case~~ Equaliser Rx - Albert
5. info theory / one page writeup - Colin
